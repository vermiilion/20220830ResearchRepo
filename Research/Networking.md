### What is a switch? What is a router?
A switch is a networking hardware that connects all the devices in a network. For example, computers, printers, servers. A router connects multiple switches and their respective networks to form an even larger network. A router works as a dispatcher and manages traffic between these networks, whereas a switch manages traffic between devices.
