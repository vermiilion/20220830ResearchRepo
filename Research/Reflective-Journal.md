### First Impressions / Thoughts 
Prior to starting this course, I had very little knowledge and understanding of basic IT concepts. I was hoping that once we started, it would get the ball rolling, but I found it difficult to keep up. One major problem I faced was that I was unfamiliar with much of the terms the rest of the class already knew, understood, or at least heard of. I found myself always having to look up definitions and explanations when any of the lecturers would start introducing us to a new concept or topic. I found myself in a loop and kept getting too overwhelmed because there would be words in the definitions and search results that I didn't fully understand and had to look THOSE up, too. I would often repeat this process and it would sometimes slow down my progress with whatever task I was doing. It does help having a classmate (Cameron) sitting next to me who was more than willing to explain thing in simpler terms. Cameron would also often look over and see me going through my "oh boy I'm so lost and confused" rabbit holes and abruptly stop me in my tracks - "What are you doing! You're just gonna confuse yourself again!" - and point me in the right direction or check if what I'm reading would confuse me too much. I did find this helpful in an energy and time saving way. However, there are benefits to going down rabbit holes. Mainly, for me, it often immerses me in whatever topic it is I'm trying to learn about and helps with capturing my interest - something I have a lot of trouble with. This hasn't been the case the past few weeks though. I feel like I can't afford the time to delve deeper and get a better understanding of the things we have learnt so far because it feels like there is too much on my plate for me to handle and there is so much to catch up on, and I know at the level I am at now, I will need ample time on one single thing in order to understand it satisfactorily and not overwhelm myself.
