# Call Prioritisation System

To manage high call volumes, calls must be assigned with levels of priority according to what needs the most immediate attention.
To assess the level of priority, many aspects of the call must be considered. Some things to consider are:
-  Who is affected - whether the problem will affect a whole business, parts of the business, or just the user. 
-  The time period in which the problem must be attended to - whether it needs urgent attention time-wise, or if it can wait - and how much time can be allowed.
-  Why the response is needed - Is something not working completely? Are there interruptions in the service? Does the customer have a question about the service? Are they requesting a service?

## Prioritisation Scale

### 1 - Highest priority: 
- Critical components down
- The problem will severely affect business
- Critical client is affected, affecting critical business productivity
- Immediate attention is required
- Non-immediate attention will result in escalation of the problem

### 2 - High Priority
- Critical components affected
- The problem will largely affect business
- Time-critical, but not immediate attention required

### 3 - Less Priority
- Non-critical components down or affected
- The problem affects only the user or few users in the business
- The problem slows down productivity, not stop it
- Doesn't require time-critical attention
- Requesting a service

### 4 - Lower Priority
- Questions regarding the service 
- Non-critical components affected
- Very little to no affect in business
- A lot of time can be allowed before attending to the problem without any significant impact
- Minor inconveniences
- Feedback
