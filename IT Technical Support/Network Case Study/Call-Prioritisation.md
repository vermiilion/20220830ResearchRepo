# Call Prioritisation System

To manage high call volumes, calls must be assigned with levels of priority according to what needs the most immediate attention.
To assess the level of priority, many aspects of the call must be considered. Some things to consider are:
-  Who is affected - whether the problem will affect a whole business or just the user. 
-  The time period in which the problem must be attended to - whether it needs urgent attention time-wise, or if it can wait - and how much time can be allowed.
-  Why the response is needed - Is something not working completely? Are there interruptions in the service? Does the customer have a question about the service? Are they requesting a service?

## Prioritisation Scale

### 1 - Highest priority: 
- Critical components down
- The problem will severely affect business
- Critical client is affected, affecting business
- The problem is one that must be attended to immediately
- Non-immediate attention will result in escalation of the problem

### 2 - High Priority
- Critical components affected
- The problem will largely affect business
- The problem should be attended to as soon as possible, but not immediately
