# NETWORKING CASE STUDY

## TASK: IDENTIFY PC REQUIREMENTS FOR AN ORGANISATION

Your employer, Spring Computers, is interested in extending their site offices. They have asked you to work on the design of the network solution while keeping in mind the fundamental concepts of IT technical support. They want to establish another site in Auckland along with the current site in Wellington, and while you are working on the design, they would like you to plan for another two sites.

### Your manager has provided you with the following list of requirements:

- Connect at least 4 computers at each site into one cohesive network.
- Ensure all communication between the sites is secure.
- Ensure each site has a centralised printer connected with all systems.
- Provide a suite of software tools available for monitoring and managing call logs and customer support.
- Design prioritisation system to handle support calls.

Available budget: $20,000/-
### Your task: develop a plan that identifies the following:

- Hardware/software components and network devices.
- Communication channel that should be used to connect both sites - You can add more than one possible option to secure the channel.
- Costs of computing equipment and network components including any servers, infrastructure, printer, related hardware, software, accessories, and security protocols.
- How will you handle the support call prioritisation?
- You also need to provide a rationale and justification for every component.

## Network Components List
| Component Name | Quantity | Price per Unit | Total Price | Reference | Justification 
| ---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Inspiron Compact Desktop|4|$973.98|$3895.92|https://www.dell.com/en-nz/shop/dell-deals-laptops-desktops-monitors-on-sale/inspiron-compact-desktop/spd/inspiron-3910-desktop/hdi391006nz|A keyboard and mouse are included with the computers. Has 16GB DDR4 for higher performance and lower power consumption.
|PowerEdge T350 Tower Server|1|$6,739.95|$6,739.95|https://www.dell.com/en-nz/shop/storage-servers-and-networking-for-business/poweredge-t350-tower-server/spd/poweredge-t350/pet350tm0211nzoo?configurationid=38b32fe9-2e70-412b-8339-1c6b9b58cfd8|I chose to have a server so the network would have a central file system and allow me to provide high speed internet access across the network. The server has much larger processing power and storage capacity compared to the workstations for this purpose. This server has 64GB of RAM, more than enough for a network of this size, and a 1.2TB Hard Drive which can be expanded if needed for future sites. It includes built-in firewall protection to prevent unauthorized access to the network.
|NETGEAR ProSAFE GS108 8-port Gigabit Switch 8x GbE|1|$74.69|$74.69|https://www.pbtech.co.nz/product/SWHNGR3083/NETGEAR-ProSAFE-GS108-8-port-Gigabit-Switch-8x-GbE|I chose an unmanaged switch because a managed switch is more expensive and not necessary for a network of this size. Only 8 ports are needed to connect all workstations, server, and printer.
|Netcomm NF10WV ADSL/VDSL Wi-Fi Modem Router|1|$131.15|$131.15|https://www.pbtech.co.nz/product/MODNCM1058/Netcomm-NF10WV-ADSLVDSL-Wi-Fi-Modem-Router-with-VO|I chose a combined modem and router because it is a more cost effective and space saving option that is easier to set up than one of separate components. I selected this router/modem due to the fact that it has up to 300mB/s network speeds, allowing rapid processing of data from call-center associated softwares. It will allow all client computers to connect to high-speed internet, and facilitate connection across sites.
|MFCL3770CDW Colour Wireless LED 4-in-1 Printer|1|$599.96|$599.96|https://www.brother.co.nz/printers/colour-laser-printers/mfcl3770cdw|This 4-in-1 printer allows you to print, scan, copy, and fax, which are often necessary for everyday office use.

|Dell 24 Monitor â€“ S2421HN|5|$229.00|$1145.00|https://www.dell.com/en-nz/shop/dell-24-monitor-s2421hn/apd/210-bdmj/monitors-monitor-accessories|The technical specs of the monitor isn't a priority as long as it serves its function. I chose an appropriate monitor size and quality.
