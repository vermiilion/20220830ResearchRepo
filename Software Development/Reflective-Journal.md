### First Impressions / Thoughts 
Prior to starting this course, I had very little knowledge and understanding of basic IT concepts. I was hoping that once we started, it would get the ball rolling, but I found it difficult to keep up. One major problem I faced was that I was unfamiliar with much of the terms the rest of the class already knew, understood, or at least heard of. I found myself always having to look up definitions and explanations when any of the lecturers would start introducing us to a new concept or topic. I found myself in a loop and kept getting too overwhelmed because there would be words in the definitions and search results that I didn't fully understand and had to look THOSE up, too. I would often repeat this process and it would sometimes slow down my progress with whatever task I was doing. It does help having a classmate (Cameron) sitting next to me who was more than willing to explain thing in simpler terms. Cameron would also often look over and see me going through my "oh boy I'm so lost and confused" rabbit holes and abruptly stop me in my tracks - "What are you doing! You're just gonna confuse yourself again!" - and point me in the right direction or check if what I'm reading would confuse me too much. I did find this helpful in an energy and time saving way. However, there are benefits to going down rabbit holes. Mainly, for me, it often immerses me in whatever topic it is I'm trying to learn about and helps with capturing my interest - something I have a lot of trouble with. This hasn't been the case the past few weeks though. I feel like I can't afford the time to delve deeper and get a better understanding of the things we have learnt so far because it feels like there is too much on my plate for me to handle and there is so much to catch up on, and I know at the level I am at now, I will need ample time on one single thing in order to understand it satisfactorily and not overwhelm myself.

## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a visual programming language and website that allows users to program interactive media such as games and animations using blocks of commands with pre-written code. These blocks are to be sequenced together to perform tasks and actions.
### What is visual programming?
Visual programming is a type of programming language that uses visual components to present processes i.e graphics, symbols, buttons that are already defined with code, in comparison to the traditional text-based programming where lines of code must be typed out in order to perform specific tasks. The idea of visual programming is to use visual concepts that make it easier for humans to understand rather than forcing them to think like a computer, which makes it a more beginner-friendly language.
### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?
I don't think I had recognised any programming principles at this point because I was still trying to wrap my head around what programming is and how it works.
I didn't have much prior knowledge of programming languages, but I do have experience and interest in learning foreign languages. I wondered if there was much similarity between the two, and if my experience will help me at all in grasping programming. I realised that they were quite fundamentally different. Programming languages are quite heavily based on problem solving, and leaves no space for error. Human languages are used to communicate between at least two parties and allows nuance, imperfections, and creativity, whereas programming languages are used for computers to carry out a series of commands. In fact, I later searched up a comparison and found [a study](https://news.mit.edu/2020/brain-reading-computer-code-1215) by MIT neuroscientists that interpreting code does not rely on regions of the brain that are involved in language processing. Despite the differences between the two, I do think there are some skills learnt from learning human languages that could be applied to programming. The main one for me being that learning foreign languages often forces you to ditch the structures and rules you already know and interpret things differently.

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
I no longer have access to this scratch project, but I made a small interactive animation where the cat asks the user to input their name, and if they input my name, the cat says hi and a compliment. Otherwise, it will increase in size and tell the user to "fuck off" because they aren't me. I also played around with the movement functions and made the cat "dance" and move across the screen. This little project helped me learn about the idea of programming and how functions such as "if" and else" work in a way that retained my attention and wasn't too overwhelming for me. There were times when I would want to try out certain commands but struggled with understanding how the blocks worked and fitted in with each other. After a lot of trial and error, I managed to learn how some of the functions work by seeing what works and what doesn't, and why. 

 ## Week 2:

### What is git?
Git is a software that allows users to track and store code, and manage changes in computer files. Primarily used by programmers working collaboratively to co-ordinate their work, Git provides features such as branches that are needed to support multiple parallel developments without disrupting each other's work, and the ability to merge branches. It is a Version Control System - a system that maintains a history of modifications to a set of data or computer file, so that it can be returned to if needed. 
### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a version control cloud-based hosting service for managing Git repositories. GitHub is useful for co-ordinating, tracking, and updating work in projects with other collaborators.

I am still quite unfamiliar with GitHub outside of basic things like creating and renaming files, forking repositories. I have yet to explore other features, and frankly I'm a little intimidated. However, I did find it satisfying using markdown in my repository, switching between the 'Edit file' and the 'Preview' section to see how things like using hashes next to some text translated visually. I think I would be interested in learning more about markup languages and get into the presentational side of coding.
 I found this [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) quite helpful, though I haven't had the need to go through all of it yet.
## Week 3:
### Intro to Python
Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language. "High-level" refers to the higher level of abstraction from machine language. High-level languages such as Python uses natural language elements and focuses on usability and readability. This makes Python an ideal programming language for beginners.

#### Some guiding principles from the Zen of Python:
* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Explicit is better than implicit.
* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Flat is better than nested.
* Sparse is better than dense.
* Readability counts.
* Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
* Although practicality beats purity.
* Errors should never pass silently.
* Unless explicitly silenced.
* In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
* There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.
* Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
* Now is better than never.
* Although never is often better than right now.
* If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
* If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
* Namespaces are one honking great idea – let's do more of those!

I found it hard to follow Sarmad's guest lecture on Intro to Python, though I suspect its partially because of the way it was taught - an online lecture where full attention is required in order to not miss out on any important details. I later tried rewatching the lecture, as well as a 1 hour [Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8&t=2309s) by Programming with Mosh to catch up. I found it useful that I could pause the video at any given time and rewind as much as needed, but ended up spending much more than an hour on the first 30 minutes of the tutorial. I couldn't get myself to do any of the exercises he provided throughout the video because I didn't even know where to start, but I found it useful when he would demonstrate errors when writing the code and explain the process behind correcting these.
Later on in the week, I had a friend's flatmate who has some experience with Python go through a few of the class exercises with me. I liked that he wasn't an expert and was unfamiliar with some of the syntax, but still more experienced, so every now and then we would have to go through parts of the [Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) to figure out which functions would work for the exercise. I would watch his process of trial and error and he would occassionally comment and explain his reasonings along the way, and then he would allow me time to ask questions and try to finish the rest of the code myself once he felt like I had some kind of understanding. I found this method of learning quite enjoyable. I would say one-on-one learning is the most effective method for me because it means I can go at my own pace, and it doesn't leave me much space to get distracted. By the end of this lesson, I knew my next step to progress in my Python journey was to take my time going through the Python Tutorial modules and understanding them, and then practice what I've learnt through exercises. (I haven't really had the time and energy to do much of this, though). 

## Week 4 & Week 5:
### Agile
Agile is an approach to project management and software development. These two weeks I had been feeling unwell so I missed most of the lessons that focused on Agile methodology. I came into Week 5's lesson a little lost, and when we performed an Agile ritual as a class where we had to gather into a circle and share with the class our ideas for our software project, I couldn't really understand what it was about this ritual that made it an Agile ritual or what Agile really is. This one was on me, though, because I haven't taken the time to research Agile and catch up with the content I missed in class. I tried attending the lesson where the class did the Marshmallow Challenge via Teams, but as Agile is a methodology that in some ways needs to be experienced to be taught and I couldn't attend the class in person or have the materials for this challenge at home with me, I couldn't have this hands-on learning experience. I could only look up what lessons the Marshmallow Challenge taught - which was about the creative software development process, and prototyping. I learnt that Kindergarten students tend to do the Marshmallow Challenge well because of their tendency to just build and build, creating multiple designs that sometimes fail and collapse but they take these failures to figure out what went wrong and improve with their next build, instead of just focusing on one set plan. 
After an overdue reading of what Agile is and its principles, I tried to apply these to what we have discussed and tried in class, but found it hard to understand what most of the principles mean and how it correlates to things we've done. The only ones I felt like I "got" were:

* Build projects around motivated individuals. 
Give them the environment and support they need, 
and trust them to get the job done."

* The most efficient and effective method of 
conveying information to and within a development 
team is face-to-face conversation."

## Week 6:
### Python Koans
Python Koans is an interactive tutorial that uses a series of exercises, or "tests" that you need to make pass in order to reach enlightment, i.e. learn Python. "Koans" is taken from Zen Buddhism - "a nonsensical or paradoxical question to a student for which an answer is demanded, the stress of meditation on the question often being illuminating." Koans would be used as a meditative technique and is meant to "break" the thinking mind.
A key principle of Buddhism is to let go of binary thinking, and the Koans are used as a tool to reach this. In a similar way, learning Python requires you to explore different ways of thinking, and creative problem solving skills seem like one of the key skills in being successful with Python (as well as other programming languages, I assume). I found doing these tests an enjoyable challenge, though I didn't really "get" it at first. I figured it wasn't all so important to "get" it, but rather the process, and how I respond when the tests return false. As of now, I have completed only 16 Koans, or 5%. 

## Reflective Questions:

### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?
I often forget, or refuse to take regular breaks from my screen when I'm doing uni work. I think it might be partially because I don't tend to pay attention to how much time has passed while doing work but rather how much work I've done. Sometimes, I feel like the break isn't deserved when I haven't done enough. Sometimes, I feel like I can't get back to the swing of things or will get too distracted if I take a break. However, I have recently gotten into the habit of working out (which includes the stretching before and after), usually prior to starting any uni work. I feel like this has helped me with my restlessness and habit making. I think taking regular breaks from the screen despite how much progress I've made during that time period could help me and my motivation, but I will really need to make an effort to make sure I do this.
### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?
I have never heard of Timeboxing before, but after a quick Google search I found out that it was a time managing technique used in Agile where you allocate a fixed time period to do a planned activity. Once the time is up, you assess whether you've reached your planned goals. If I've learned anything from doing my Research Repository reflections, the Marshmallow Challenge, or coding, it's that a vital part of the learning process is to assess and reflect on your progress and work, and use this to help you in your next steps. By reflecting, you can have an idea of what needs improvement and how you would go about achieving this. I think Timeboxing could be a useful way to manage my upcoming assignments and I would like to try it out.
### On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?
* **Research Repository - 4/5** To my understanding, this assignment is a teaching/learning tool and relies more heavily on the reflecting on my progress and process rather than the actual learning content. Knowing this, I feel less stressed and incapable because I'm focusing more on my learning journey rather than worrying if I'm doing something "good enough" or not, and therefore more motivated to do the work. I felt like I started this course at 0 so there was a lot of learning potential, and I already believed it was necessary for me to assess my learning progress for this course in order for me to improve. I'm grateful that this assignment allowed me the time to focus on doing this without making me feel like I'm wasting my study time.
* **Networking Case Study - 2/5** I still feel like I am far behind with the content (See First Impressions/Thoughts section). I have not made much progress with my network design. 
* **My Software Project - 3/5** I'm still stuck on ideas for my Software Project and I'm unsure how "complex" I can make it based on my ability, but I do not dread working on this assignment. That doesn't seem like much, but it is very important to me. I am determined to make my project personal and enjoyable.
* **Security Trends Presentation - 3/5** I'm petrified of public speaking, but I'm somewhat confident in my researching ability. However, I'm worried I will have a lot of trouble understanding what I am researching.

### What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?

### Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself. 


### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?
Management is key! Whether it is time management, or managing my feelings. There will be plenty of new and complicated things I will have to wrap my head around, but don't get discouraged. Other people are struggling too, and just because I don't think I have made as much progress as others, don't let this be a reason to give up or feel bad about myself. Allow breaks when needed, allocate certain time slots in my week for uni work, and when I'm stuck, take a break and come back to it with a fresh perspective. Try to work on things one thing at a time, a little bit at a time, so that I don't get overwhelmed and ditch it entirely. Don't be afraid to ask questions and ask for help! Classmates are more than happy to help out, and teaching others is also a good way to learn. Also don't forget to save your work frequently!!
### What is Python?

### Have you developed a habit of exploring?

### Have you meditated before?

### Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?

### Do you consider yourself a developer yet?

### Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
I have about 16 tabs open on my browser and all of them are study related tabs. This may sound like I'm onto it, but in reality, my online distractions usually come from my mobile phone. I feel more comfortable doing things on mobile and tend to use my phone to do most of the Googling, checking emails, as well as non-study related things like messaging, rather than doing it on desktop. I found myself a trick for not letting myself get distracted by my mobile phone - my sister recently moved out and the wifi doesn't reach her room when I use my mobile, but it reaches my laptop. I've been making it a habit to do my uni work in her old room, so I'm not tempted by notifications.
### Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?
Yes, I'm about to fight my damn Macbook right now because the dock/internet browser stopped responding and after trying everything I could, I had to restart the dock and I lost hours of work. This is the second time this has happened this week. Thoughts like "This is why I fucking hate computers" went through my head. And then I remember that's partially the reason I wanted to take this course in the first place - to have a better relationship with computers and IT. From now on, I will commit changes more frequently so less work is lost if the same thing happens again. (Although this time, it became unresponsive in the middle of me clicking the 'Commit changes' button. Lucky me.) I figured it would stress me out even more if I dwelled on the work I lost so I will just count my losses, be grateful that I still remember the gist of what I said, and move on.
