### First Impressions / Thoughts 
Prior to starting this course, I had very little knowledge and understanding of basic IT concepts. I was hoping that once we started, it would get the ball rolling, but I found it difficult to keep up. One major problem I faced was that I was unfamiliar with much of the terms the rest of the class already knew, understood, or at least heard of. I found myself always having to look up definitions and explanations when any of the lecturers would start introducing us to a new concept or topic. I found myself in a loop and kept getting too overwhelmed because there would be words in the definitions and search results that I didn't fully understand and had to look THOSE up, too. I would often repeat this process and it would sometimes slow down my progress with whatever task I was doing. It does help having a classmate (Cameron) sitting next to me who was more than willing to explain thing in simpler terms. Cameron would also often look over and see me going through my "oh boy I'm so lost and confused" rabbit holes and abruptly stop me in my tracks - "What are you doing! You're just gonna confuse yourself again!" - and point me in the right direction or check if what I'm reading would confuse me too much. I did find this helpful in an energy and time saving way. However, there are benefits to going down rabbit holes. Mainly, for me, it often immerses me in whatever topic it is I'm trying to learn about and helps with capturing my interest - something I have a lot of trouble with. This hasn't been the case the past few weeks though. I feel like I can't afford the time to delve deeper and get a better understanding of the things we have learnt so far because it feels like there is too much on my plate for me to handle and there is so much to catch up on, and I know at the level I am at now, I will need ample time on one single thing in order to understand it satisfactorily and not overwhelm myself.

## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a visual programming language and website that allows users to program interactive media such as games and animations using blocks of commands with pre-written code. These blocks are to be sequenced together to perform tasks and actions.
### What is visual programming?
Visual programming is a type of programming language that uses visual components to present processes i.e graphics, symbols, buttons that are already defined with code, in comparison to the traditional text-based programming where lines of code must be typed out in order to perform specific tasks. The idea of visual programming is to use visual concepts that make it easier for humans to understand rather than forcing them to think like a computer, which makes it a more beginner-friendly language.
### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?
I don't think I had recognised any programming principles at this point because I was still trying to wrap my head around what programming is and how it works.
I didn't have much prior knowledge of programming languages, but I do have experience and interest in learning foreign languages. I wondered if there was much similarity between the two, and if my experience will help me at all in grasping programming. I realised that they were quite fundamentally different. Programming languages are quite heavily based on problem solving, and leaves no space for error. Human languages are used to communicate between at least two parties and allows nuance, imperfections, and creativity, whereas programming languages are used for computers to carry out a series of commands. In fact, I later searched up a comparison and found [a study](https://news.mit.edu/2020/brain-reading-computer-code-1215) by MIT neuroscientists that interpreting code does not rely on regions of the brain that are involved in language processing. Despite the differences between the two, I do think there are some skills learnt from learning human languages that could be applied to programming. The main one for me being that learning foreign languages often forces you to ditch the structures and rules you already know and interpret things differently.

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
I no longer have access to this scratch project, but I made a small interactive animation where the cat asks the user to input their name, and if they input my name, the cat says hi and a compliment. Otherwise, it will increase in size and tell the user to "fuck off" because they aren't me. I also played around with the movement functions and made the cat "dance" and move across the screen. This little project helped me learn about the idea of programming and how functions such as "if" and else" work in a way that retained my attention and wasn't too overwhelming for me. There were times when I would want to try out certain commands but struggled with understanding how the blocks worked and fitted in with each other. After a lot of trial and error, I managed to learn how some of the functions work by seeing what works and what doesn't, and why. 

 ## Week 2:

### What is git?
Git is a software that allows users to track and store code, and manage changes in computer files. Primarily used by programmers working collaboratively to co-ordinate their work, Git provides features such as branches that are needed to support multiple parallel developments without disrupting each other's work, and the ability to merge branches. It is a Version Control System - a system that maintains a history of modifications to a set of data or computer file, so that it can be returned to if needed. 
### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a version control cloud-based hosting service for managing Git repositories. GitHub is useful for co-ordinating, tracking, and updating work in projects with other collaborators.

I am still quite unfamiliar with GitHub outside of basic things like creating and renaming files, forking repositories. I have yet to explore other features, and frankly I'm a little intimidated. However, I did find it satisfying using markdown in my repository, switching between the 'Edit file' and the 'Preview' section to see how things like using hashes next to some text translated visually. I think I would be interested in learning more about markup languages and get into the presentational side of coding.
 I found this [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) quite helpful, though I haven't had the need to go through all of it yet.
## Week 3:
### Intro to Python
Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language. "High-level" refers to the higher level of abstraction from machine language. High-level languages such as Python uses natural language elements and focuses on usability and readability. This makes Python an ideal programming language for beginners.

#### Some guiding principles from the Zen of Python:
* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Explicit is better than implicit.
* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Flat is better than nested.
* Sparse is better than dense.
* Readability counts.
* Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
* Although practicality beats purity.
* Errors should never pass silently.
* Unless explicitly silenced.
* In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
* There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.[a]
* Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
* Now is better than never.
* Although never is often better than right now.
* If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
* If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
* Namespaces are one honking great idea – let's do more of those!

I found it hard to follow Sarmad's guest lecture on Intro to Python, though I suspect its partially because of the way it was taught - an online lecture where full attention is required in order to not miss out on any important details. I later tried rewatching the lecture, as well as a 1 hour [Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8&t=2309s) by Programming with Mosh to catch up. I found it useful that I could pause the video at any given time and rewind as much as needed, but ended up spending much more than an hour on the first 30 minutes of the tutorial. I couldn't get myself to do any of the exercises he provided throughout the video because I didn't even know where to start, but I found it useful when he would demonstrate errors when writing the code and explain the process behind correcting these.
Later on in the week, I had a friend's flatmate who has some experience with Python go through a few of the class exercises with me. I liked that he wasn't an expert and was unfamiliar with some of the functions but still more experienced, so every now and then we would have to go through parts of the [Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) to figure out which functions would work for the exercise. I would watch his process of trial and error and he would occassionally comment and explain his reasonings along the way, and then he would allow me time to ask questions and try to finish the rest of the code myself once he felt like I had some kind of understanding. I found this method of learning quite enjoyable. I would say one-on-one learning is the most effective method for me because it means I can go at my own pace, and it doesn't leave me much space to get distracted.

## Week 4 & Week 5:
Agile

## Week 6:
Python Koans is an interactive tutorial that uses a series of exercises, or "tests" that you need to make pass in order to reach enlightment, i.e. learn Python. "Koans" is taken from Zen Buddhism - "a nonsensical or paradoxical question to a student for which an answer is demanded, the stress of meditation on the question often being illuminating." Koans would be used as a meditative technique and is meant to "break" the thinking mind.
