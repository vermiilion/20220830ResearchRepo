## Reflective Questions:

### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?
I often forget, or refuse to take regular breaks from my screen when I'm doing uni work. I think it might be partially because I don't tend to pay attention to how much time has passed while doing work but rather how much work I've done. Sometimes, I feel like the break isn't deserved when I haven't done enough. Sometimes, I feel like I can't get back to the swing of things or will get too distracted if I take a break. However, I have recently gotten into the habit of working out (which includes the stretching before and after), usually prior to starting any uni work. I feel like this has helped me with my restlessness and habit making. I think taking regular breaks from the screen despite how much progress I've made during that time period could help me and my motivation, but I will really need to make an effort to make sure I do this.

### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?
I have never heard of Timeboxing before, but after a quick Google search I found out that it was a time managing technique used in Agile where you allocate a fixed time period to do a planned activity. Once the time is up, you assess whether you've reached your planned goals. If I've learned anything from doing my Research Repository reflections, the Marshmallow Challenge, or coding, it's that a vital part of the learning process is to assess and reflect on your progress and work, and use this to help you in your next steps. By reflecting, you can have an idea of what needs improvement and how you would go about achieving this. I think Timeboxing could be a useful way to manage my upcoming assignments and I would like to try it out.

### On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?
* **Research Repository - 4/5** To my understanding, this assignment is a teaching/learning tool and relies more heavily on the reflecting on my progress and process rather than the actual learning content. Knowing this, I feel less stressed and incapable because I'm focusing more on my learning journey rather than worrying if I'm doing something "good enough" or not, and therefore more motivated to do the work. I felt like I started this course at 0 so there was a lot of learning potential, and I already believed it was necessary for me to assess my learning progress for this course in order for me to improve. I'm grateful that this assignment allowed me the time to focus on doing this without making me feel like I'm wasting my study time.
* **Networking Case Study - 2/5** I still feel like I am far behind with the content (See First Impressions/Thoughts section). I have not made much progress with my network design. 
* **My Software Project - 3/5** I'm still stuck on ideas for my Software Project and I'm unsure how "complex" I can make it based on my ability, but I do not dread working on this assignment. That doesn't seem like much, but it is very important to me. I am determined to make my project personal and enjoyable.
* **Security Trends Presentation - 3/5** I'm petrified of public speaking, but I'm somewhat confident in my researching ability. However, I'm worried I will have a lot of trouble understanding what I am researching.

### What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?
During Week 6's Python Koans lesson, I had a go at explaining and teaching another student for the first time in this course, rather than the other way around. Although I didn't feel like I was in any place to do that, especially since this was our first lesson doing Koans, this helped with my confidence and attitude towards my progress. Prior to this, I felt like I was all alone in my confusion and that I was constantly behind everyone else. Helping out a fellow student made me realise that we all make progress at different rates, and if I was able to have enough of a grasp on a topic to help somebody else, I wasn't as lost as I thought I was.

### Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself.
I don't think I had a personal learning strategy, but I would sometimes make myself rules to motivate me to do work. These included:
* Only going out to see friends after I have done "enough" uni work
* Leaving my leisure movie and cartoon watching time for after finishing my tasks
* If I'm struggling to sit there and do work, go have a workout and come back to it

I didn't usually specify how much work I had to do before I rewarded myself so I don't think it was very affective, and I usually would still end up going out even if I felt like I didn't do "enough" which made my rules redundant.

### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?
Management is key! Whether it is time management, or managing my feelings. There will be plenty of new and complicated things I will have to wrap my head around, but don't get discouraged. Other people are struggling too, and just because I don't think I have made as much progress as others, don't let this be a reason to give up or feel bad about myself. Allow breaks when needed, allocate certain time slots in my week for uni work, and when I'm stuck, take a break and come back to it with a fresh perspective. Try to work on things one thing at a time, a little bit at a time, so that I don't get overwhelmed and ditch it entirely. Don't be afraid to ask questions and ask for help! Classmates are more than happy to help out, and teaching others is also a good way to learn. Also don't forget to save your work frequently!!

### Have you developed a habit of exploring?
I think I do have a habit of exploring, but like I mentioned in my First Impressions, my exploring would sometimes get me lost. I don't always have to see this as a bad thing, though. I think (almost) anything learnt is useful, even though it might not be what's necessary to get good grades. Anyway, what I want from this course is not good grades or a qualification. I just want to learn.

### Have you meditated before?
I've only ever made half-assed attempts to meditate. I always hear it's good for mindfulness and mental health which is why I wanted to try it, but I'm not sure if I'm fully convinced. I  usually find myself too restless and have too much on my mind to do it properly. Maybe I will try again, but I will have to have a strong will to actually try properly.
### Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?

### Do you consider yourself a developer yet?
Honestly, I don't think I understand what it means to be a developer yet, so I would say no. 

### Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?
I've always valued creativity but I have a weird relationship with it. I enjoy creative activities, like visual arts, but often struggle with the creativity component of it. I'm not sure I understand the question properly, but I think creativity and logical thinking go hand-in-hand. Logic uses reasoning and analytical skills and often tries to identify patterns and cause and effect. Logical thinking is reliable, but not all the time. Many ideas and problems can't be solved with only binary thinking. Sometimes to solve problems, you must look ahead of already established patterns and think outside the box. Learning to think creatively can improve your approach when using logic. 

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
I have about 16 tabs open on my browser and all of them are study related tabs. This may sound like I'm onto it, but in reality, my online distractions usually come from my mobile phone. I feel more comfortable doing things on mobile and tend to use my phone to do most of the Googling, checking emails, as well as non-study related things like messaging, rather than doing it on desktop. I found myself a trick for not letting myself get distracted by my mobile phone - my sister recently moved out and the wifi doesn't reach her room when I use my mobile, but it reaches my laptop. I've been making it a habit to do my uni work in her old room, so I'm not tempted by notifications.

### Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?
Yes, I'm about to fight my damn Macbook right now because the dock/internet browser stopped responding and after trying everything I could, I had to restart the dock and I lost hours of work. This is the second time this has happened this week. Thoughts like "This is why I fucking hate computers" went through my head. And then I remember that's partially the reason I wanted to take this course in the first place - to have a better relationship with computers and IT. From now on, I will commit changes more frequently so less work is lost if the same thing happens again. (Although this time, it became unresponsive in the middle of me clicking the 'Commit changes' button. Lucky me.) I figured it would stress me out even more if I dwelled on the work I lost so I will just count my losses, be grateful that I still remember the gist of what I said, and move on.

### What is an IDE?
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application designed to maximise productivity in writing and testing software by combining common developer tools into one aplication. They usually include a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. They also often have syntax highlighting, which shows different parts of the source code in different colours to help with readability and understanding what parts of the code does. The IDE we have been using is Visual Studio Code.

### So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?
Not exactly a moment, but I think the hardest part of this course for me was to keep focused and motivated. I was constantly getting overwhelmed which affected my performance, and made me put a lot of things off. Another one was finding the will to keep going after I had lost some of my work. I realised that it is important to think about what I can do to take a step forward, even if just by a little, instead of staying in the same place.

### Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?
Ways that I found the Canvas modules helpful was that it essentially gave me a list of topics for me to learn, sectioned organisationally. A lot of the time, I didn't have the "bigger picture" or I would miss parts of lectures. Knowing which content is useful for me to learn was helpful, although I didn't get through too many of the modules because I spent too long on each one and then got too frustrated.

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious? Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?
What I mostly found tedious was learning all the new terms and concepts and trying to understand them. This took me so much time and energy. I would often get discouraged or put off because even after reading multiple explanations from different sources, I felt like I still didn't understand it. It made me feel slow and stupid.

### What is OOP?
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It relies on concepts of classes and objects, rather than function and logic. Software is designed by using these objects that contain data and interact with each other. The main principles of object-oriented programming are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism. 

### What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism means "many-shaped". In computer science, polymorphism refers to situations in which something can occur in different forms. 
Polymorphism is a core concept of OOP that allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

### What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?
MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product. It is a development technique where a product in its most basic form is introduced to the market in order to validate a product idea early in the product development cycle and get sufficient feedback, which will help guide it towards its final product. If I were to describe this concept to a group of 6 year olds, I would compare it to a draft version or a brainstorm of a piece of writing or story. The draft or brainstorm is usually first checked by the teacher, who now knows the general idea or storyline and will give feedback or suggestions on where to go next. The student will then take the feedback and use this to aid in writing a final piece. I think 6 year olds are used to the concept of teachers checking their work and giving feedback, so this would be a sufficient enough comparison, except instead of a piece of writing or drawing, it will be a product instead.

### What is pair programming?
Pair programming is an Agile technique where two different programmers share a workstation. Each take the role of either the "Driver" or the "Navigator". The Driver is in charge of writing the code while the Navigator reviews the lines of code as it is typed in as well as assessing the next steps. The roles each programmer takes on typically switches frequently. Advantages of pair programming include efficiency and improving communication and teamwork skills. The code is constantly being reviewed so more mistakes will be caught, and quickly, when they are made.

### What is a variable?
A variable is any characteristics or value that can be measured or changed. A variable is used to store information.

### What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?
I'm still unfamiliar with the differences between different programming languages, only the names.
